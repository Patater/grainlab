### Process

(HAND MIX)

1. Combine all ingredients except the salt and rye berries and leaven in a bowl by stirring with a spoon for 5 minutes. Desired dough temperature: 80F.

2. Let the dough rest 45 minutes.

3. Place stiff leaven on top of dough and fold in repeatedly to mix. Rest 45 minutes.

3. Stir in the salt and red fife berries and mix with a spoon for another 10 minutes. The dough will be sticky and concrete-like in appearance.

4. Let the dough ferment for 2 hours at around 80ºF and then retard the dough for 8-12 hours in the fridge.

5. Remove the dough from the fridge and let dough sit out in a warm place for 1 hour.

6. Use wet hands to shape the dough into a log, roll in coarse dark rye flour and place in an oiled pullman pan.

7. Proof the dough for 2 hours in a warm place.

8. Bake in a 360ºF oven for 75-90 minutes with steam or a cover on the pullman for the first 45 minutes. Optionally, remove pan covering later in the bake for more color on top.

9. Remove from the oven and immediately de-pan. Allow the dough to cool and then wrap in a kitchen towel for 24 hours before slicing.
