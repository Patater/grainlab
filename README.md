# Grainlab
An artisan baker's collection of master formulas.

This collection aims to catalog healthy and nutritious breads with an emphasis on

💪 home milled or freshly milled flours  
🌱 sprouted wheat flour  
🌾 whole grains  
🍁 heritage grains  
🥖 extended fermentations  

The goal of this project is to provide formulations at home and commercial scale for bakers interested in preserving a legacy of wheat and grains with an emphasis on health and flavor.


## Organization
Some of these classifications will overlap, so I have tipped the scale one direction or the other.

**Flatbread:** Doughs with or without leaven fitting of the name flatbread.

**Levain Breads:** Anything that uses a natural leavening agent or sourdough starter. This includes sponge and biga.

**Miscelaneous Breads:** Various novelties and hard to classify breads such as bagels.

**Pasta:** Recipes for fresh pasta doughs as well as gnocchi and risotto.

**Pastry:** All baked goods any rational dentist or doctor would have you avoid.

**Pizza:** Pizza, focaccia and calzone.

**Porridge, Cracked Grain & Flaked Grain:** Breads with these additions.

**Sprouted Grain:** Breads with sprouted grain additions, sprouted & pulped, or utilizing sprouted wheat flour.

**Straight Doughs:** Dough with commercial yeast without pre-ferments, usually quick and same day bake.

**Whole Wheat & Rye:** Any bread featuring a significant quantity of either and not simply an addition.

**Yeasted Pre-Ferments:** Doughs using commercial yeast that ferment before making the final dough.
